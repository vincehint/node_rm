# Using Node

**Installing Node**
1. Update Homebrew with the lastest version of Node using *"brew update"*
2. Install node using *"brew install node"*
3. Verify that it worked with *"node -v"*

** Now let's set up a new project **
1. Create a new folder, so just open one up in the editor of your choice.
2. Initialize Node inside that folder using *"npm init"*
    -This will automatically make a package.json file
3. Make your entry point, which should be index.js, so make that file using *" touch index.js "*
4. Start coding!
